            Job websites serve as the modern equivalent of classified ads by compiling and listing available
            telecommute, remote, and local openings. They're equipped with millions of listings and additional resources
            like career coaching, resume tailoring, and blog posts full of helpful tips. Using a job website is one of
            the best and most efficient ways to search for and apply to dozens of opportunities.
